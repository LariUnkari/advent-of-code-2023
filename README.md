Solutions for Advent of Code 2023 using Processing

NOTE! Processing limitations!

The repository must by cloned to a folder named exactly 'Processing' because Processing expects the main .pde file to match the folder name. Also the folder/pde-file can't be numbers like '2023'. So I went with the simple solution.

All .pde files also need to be at the root level, unfortunately.
